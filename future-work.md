title: Future Work - H-CAT

# Future Work (H-CAT v2)

## 1. WiFi Integration

There are a lot of interesting things I could do with WiFi integration. The possibilites are too numerous to even speculate.

TODO: speculate

## 2. OLED Display

I think this would work incredibly with an OLED display. With the OLED's deep blacks it would be able to create a very convincing holographic effect, with much higher resolution than the current setup.

## 3. Processor Swap

At time of writing this, I haven't even started on the software. It's possible that I'll be able to come up with interesting ML processes that totally surpass the capabilities of the current setup. If that's the case, there are more powerful boards at the same size that could be used to run the software.

On the other hand, there are smaller boards out there that could probably run this software. It might be interesting to make a more compact version of this project, but the v1 is still pretty small, and I need some amount of space to "hide" the projector. I could just take a single 1x1 LED grid and mount it on an Adafruit Feather board with a little battery, no projector, but that seems too obvious.

## 4. Some kind of App / Software

This idea would only really make sense if this was a product for sale. I could make an app that would allow users to customize and control their H-CAT. I could also push updates to all the H-CATs.

## 5. Speakers

Again, so many applications

## 6. Refine the idea

Another "product" idea - what exactly is the H-CAT? Like what is the point? I like it because it's cool and fun to build. It's not a viable product thought. The components alone are over $100, before the enclosure. Is it art? Is it a tool? Is it a companion? 

Art - No, I think it's cool but it's not meaningful. It doesn't say anything, except for the time. However, it's aesthetically pleasing. Oh no, I've accidentally wandered directly into a conversation about the nature of art. Wandering on...

Tool - Again, yes and no. It's not super useful. One of the modes is explicitly art, and another is genetic programming on a $30 board, not exactly "useful". It does have a clock though. 

Companion - Currently hard no. This is a v2 or v3 idea, largely stemming from the coincidental usage of the word "cat" in H-CAT. I was thinking early on that my design has a lot of blank space on the front, I thought about putting some googly eyes on, and the reflector at the bottom would kind of look like a mouth. I didn't pursue the idea much further though, because with 128 LEDs, there's not a ton of interesting stuff that I could do with the "mouth". However with an OLED, the possibilities are endless.

It would be easy to get a 3D printer and design an enclosure styled like a big chibi cat head, maybe put it on a little cat body stand with suction cups on the paws to keep it in place. I could even put a motor or two in the neck to make the head move. I'd also have to do something with the eyes, maybe make them screens too? Or I could also make them reflectors. If the head was wide enough, I could put upward facing projectors on either side of the main display tube. If I put the reflectors on motors and ran a face tracking software, I could make the head move to follow the viewer, and dynamically align the reflectors to direct the image to the viewer. The idea is a very "cyber-cat", I'm really not going for realism. 

### Refinement - Conclusions

I'm not in love this idea. I don't hate it either. It's just so far away from what I'm working on right now. This is my wild speculation about ways that this could be a viable product.

I think if I was ever going to try to sell this, it's got to be either a $1000+ super fancy, AI, life guiding, cat-themed, best friend, life partner, oracle that can do all your work for you, or I've got to cut the nice LEDs and make the whole thing like $40. It'll probably end up being 1 of 1, which is fine.
