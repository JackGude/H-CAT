title: Future Work - H-CAT

# Future Work (H-CAT v2)

## 1. WiFi Integration

There are a lot of interesting things I could do with WiFi integration. The possibilites are too numerous to even speculate.

## 2. OLED Display

I think this would work incredibly with an OLED display. With the OLED's deep blacks it would be able to create a very convincing holographic effect, with much higher resolution than the current setup.

## 3. Processor Swap

At time of writing this, I haven't even started on the software. It's possible that I'll be able to come up with interesting ML processes that totally surpass the capabilities of the current setup. If that's the case, there are more powerful boards at the same size that could be used to run the software.

On the other hand, there are smaller boards out there that could probably run this software. It might be interesting to make a more compact version of this project, but the v1 is still pretty small, and I need some amount of space to "hide" the projector. I could just take a single 1x1 LED grid and mount it on an Adafruit Feather board with a little battery, no projector, but that seems too obvious.

## 4. Some kind of App / Software

This idea would only really make sense if this was a product for sale. I could make an app that would allow users to customize and control their H-CAT. I could also push updates to all the H-CATs.
