title: H-CAT
---

This is the documentation hub for H-CAT, a compact desktop display featuring cellular automata simulations, generative art, and a precision clock. The project will make use of the Pepper's ghost illusion effect to display a reflected "hologram" from a hidden light source.

## Project Overview

H-CAT started as a computer engineering student project. I wanted to get more experience working in the real world, and to build up my electronics / EE skills. I've always enjoyed making things so I just wanted to make "something" that would be beautiful and/or useful (ideally both) and since I don't have a lot of space, it needs to be compact and unobtrusive. So all together, for requirements we have: something simple(-ish), well-built, and compact that is also useful and aesthetically pleasing.
